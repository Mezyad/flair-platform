      <p>In Sprint 4, we completed the following activities:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The events in the home page have links</li>
        <li>The home page has a list of events</li>
        <li>The events have an image</li>
        <li>Events that are over are not shown</li>
        <li>Event detail pages created</li>
        <li>RSVPd form on each event detail page created and tested to allow only Yale email addresses</li>
        <li>Coded form for creating new events</li>
        <li>Created the functions for validation (they work but the tests is yet to pass)</li>
        <li>If the form is not valid it will show the errors</li>
        <li>Added Google Analytics to page</li>
        
      </ol>

      <b style="text-decoration:underline">Scrum activities</b>
      <br> We did the following scrum activities as a part of this sprint:
      <br> We had a <b>15 min scrum meeting</b> while in class on Monday (11/9) to understand what what everyone has done till now, what they will be doing then onwards and if anyone is facing obstacles. Through this meeting, we were able to resolve big issue in integrating the validation branch as app was crashing everytime.
      <br> We also did a sprint retrospective and released working code to Heroku.

      <br>
      <br>
      <b><i>What went well during the sprint cycle?</i></b>
      <ol>
        <li>We fixed several home and about pages codes so the tests pass because we were focusing more on just coding without testing</li>
        <li>We worked on branches</li>
        <li>We managed to finish some tasks in less time than expected such as (deleting old events) and we used this time to meet the unexpected new tasks</li>
        
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <b><i>What went wrong during the sprint cycle?</i></b>
      <ol>
        <li>We spent more time on making the tests pass than on coding new things</li>
        <li>We are having trouble and feeling desperate because some functions are working but still the test doesn’t pass and we don’t know why </li>
        <li>The new tasks added in the middle of our workload created a disruption to the plans we already had. As you can see in the graph the expectation is that we will not be able to finish the project on time (Pessimistic estimation)</li>

      </ol>
    </div>



    <div class="row">
      <b><i>What could we do differently to improve?</i></b>
      <ol>
        <li>From the beginning of our coding we should make sure that tests pass so we don’t lose extra time fixing code</li>
        <li>Create more pull requests even if they are small commits </li>
        <li>Agree on meeting at least once a week</li>
        <li>We should be better prepared to receive more unexpected tasks from the owners during our process</li>

      </ol>
