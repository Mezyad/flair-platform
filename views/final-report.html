      <br>
      <p>The traffic of our website is 98% referral and the three major sources of traffic are Yale Law School, Yale School of Management and Yale search. The share of the sources can be seen in the following table and chart;</p>
      <img src="/images/sources-traffic.png" style="width:500px">
      <p>From the 8700 people that come into our webpage only 6.35% stay and continue to one of our other pages. The pages where the traffic continues are:
</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Event 1</li>
        <li>Event 2</li>
        <li>Event 0</li>
        <li>Event 5</li>
        <li>Others</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Out of this 6.35% only 12% continue from which the only pages that continues to the donation page are Event 1 and Event 0. The page that keeps and converts more traffic is the Events page because 90% of the traffic continues to another of the following;
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>New Event</li>
        <li>About</li>
        <li>Index</li>
        <li>Others</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Out of the traffic that stays in transit 79% continues and the principal pages where it goes are Events and Index. All of this can be seen in the next image.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/flow.png" style="width:500px">
    <p>The first variation that we tested was if the word “RSVP” placed on the event box would increase the click-through rate in comparison with not having this word. Our original version is without the “RSVP” word and our Variation 1 is with the “RSVP” word as shown in the following pictures
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Original:</p>
    <img src="/images/withoutrsvp.png" style="width:500px">
    <p>Version 1:</p>
    <img src="/images/RSVP.png" style="width:500px">
    <p>For this test we can say that our having the “RSVP” word increases the click-through rate by 1.94% and has a 50% probability of outperforming our Original.</p>
   <img src="/images/RSVP-test.png" style="width:500px">
   <p>The second variation that we tested was the preference of our traffic for donating vs supporting an event. On the detail of the events, our Original version had a button that said “Support this event” and “Donate to this event” for our Variation 1 as it can be seen in the following images: 
    </p>
    <p>Original:</p>
    <img src="/images/support.png" style="width:500px">
    <p>Version 1:</p>
    <img src="/images/donate.png" style="width:500px">
    <p>For this test we don’t have enough information to come to come to a conclusion because the Donate version has a lower click-through rate but a slightly higher probability of outperforming the Support version as it can be seen in the next image:</p>

    Here ends what I added for the Final Report. I left the past code in case someone wants to use it. Atte Susana

      <b style="text-decoration:underline">Scrum activities</b><br>
      <br> We did the following scrum activities as a part of this sprint:<br>
      <br> We had a <b>15 min scrum meeting</b> while in class last Monday (11/9) to understand what what everyone has done till now, what they will be doing then onwards and if anyone is facing obstacles. Through this meeting, we were able to resolve big issue in integrating the validation branch as app was crashing everytime.<br>
      <br> We had a <b>sprint planning meeting</b> this Monday (11/16) to understand the additional requirements that were made part of the project:
        <ul>
          <li>We looked at the user stories in the email by Prof Kyle Jensen and then broke those down into smaller stories to follow the <b>INVEST</b> criteria. </li>
          <li>We then estimated the size of each of these stories through a round of <b>planning poker</b>.</li>
          <li>Each of us took up the tasks we want to work on for the next sprint</li>
          <li>All the stories for this feature has been uploaded to Waffle.io so that we can keep a track of where we are.</li>
        </ul>
      <br> We also did a sprint retrospective and released working code to Heroku.
      <br><br>
      <b style="text-decoration:underline">Sprint 4 Retrospective</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b><i>What went well during the sprint cycle?</i></b>
      <ol>
        <li>We fixed several pieces of code on the Home and About pages so the tests pass. This was because we were more focused on coding up the features rather than checking every single test.</li>
        <li>We used branches and pull requests and thus had no issues with merging code, unlike the previous sprint.</li>
        <li>We managed to finish some tasks in less time than expected such as (deleting old events) and we used this time to start the unexpected new tasks (Google Analytics tracking code).</li>
        
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <b><i>What went wrong during the sprint cycle?</i></b>
      <ol>
        <li>We spent more time on making tests pass than on coding new things</li>
        <li>We are having trouble and feeling a bit desperate because some functions are working but still the test doesn’t pass and we don’t know why (form validation). We have had to give more time to this task in the next sprint which was unplanned. </li>
        <li>The new tasks added in the middle of our workload created a disruption to the plans we already had. As you can see in the graph the expectation is that we will not be able to finish the project on time (Pessimistic estimation)</li>

      </ol>
    </div>



    <div class="row">
      <b><i>What could we do differently to improve?</i></b>
      <ol>
        <li>From the beginning of our coding we should make sure that tests pass so we don’t lose extra time fixing code later</li>
        <li>Create more pull requests even if they are small commits instead of committing a whole chunk of code at the end</li>
        <li>Agree on meeting at least once a week</li>
        <li>We should be better prepared to receive more unexpected tasks from the stakeholders during our process</li>

      </ol>
